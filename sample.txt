         '''In today's fast-paced and highly interconnected world, technology has revolutionized nearly every aspect of human life, from the way we communicate and work to how we access information, entertain ourselves, and even manage our daily routines, with smartphones, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the internet playing crucial roles in shaping modern society by enabling instant global communication, facilitating remote work, streamlining complex processes, and providing an unprecedented level of convenience that previous generations could hardly have imagined; however, while these advancements have brought countless benefits, such as increased efficiency, improved accessibility to education and healthcare, and the ability to stay connected with friends and family regardless of physical distance, they have also introduced new challenges and concerns, including privacy risks, cybersecurity threats, social isolation, and the potential for misinformation to spread rapidly across digital platforms, making it essential for individuals, businesses, and governments to strike a delicate balance between embracing innovation and implementing safeguards to protect personal data, ensure online security, and promote ethical technology use, all while fostering a digital landscape that encourages creativity, inclusivity, and meaningful human interactions rather than dependency on screens and algorithms to dictate every aspect of daily life.''']










text = '''The vast and opaque power of Elon Musk is only growing as he seeks new targets for his federal government shredding machine.

The head of President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency is closing in on his latest victim — an independent government agency set up to shield Americans from the Wall Street excesses that caused the Great Recession.

Employees of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau were abruptly told Sunday afternoon that the watchdog’s Washington, DC, headquarters will be closed this week and they should work remotely, a day after Trump’s budget chief, Russell Vought, took over as acting director and told staff to stop fighting financial abuse.

“CFPB RIP,” Musk wrote on X on Friday.

The agency, which has long been in GOP sights, seems to be following a similar path to doom as the US Agency for International Development, which has saved millions of lives around the world and promoted democracy for decades, but that Musk has eviscerated. On Sunday, Trump called USAID “crazy” and “a big scam.”

Trump is gutting an agency that his daughter once championed

Trump’s untrimmed use of executive power to throttle agencies enshrined in the law, dismiss staff and halt spending already approved by Congress is raising alarms that he’s openly defying the Constitution, seizing power that the presidency does not have.

But the role of Musk, with his unelected power, is unprecedented. The richest man in the world is firing or suspending government workers, destroying US soft global power, and accessing data and private information about potentially millions of Americans — all with zero accountability.

Multiple courts have now stepped in to temporarily halt Trump and Musk’s plans. But everything is trending toward one of the most significant showdowns over the scope of presidential power in modern history, which is destined for a Supreme Court whose conservative majority has an expansive view of executive authority.

Plenty of people have predicted that Musk and Trump are headed for a breakup given their volatile personalities and need to be the alpha dog in every room. But Trump is showing no public sign of tiring of the Tesla pioneer, who is acting as the lead agent in the president’s revenge and disruption agenda. The president even shrugged off a Time Magazine cover that showed Musk behind the Oval Office desk.

“I’ve had a great help with Elon Musk, who’s been terrific,” Trump said in a Super Bowl interview that aired on Fox on Sunday. As to whether he trusted Musk, Trump replied: “Trust Elon? Oh, he’s not gaining anything. In fact, I wonder how he can devote the time to it. He’s so into it.”

Their alliance might be more enduring than many expect.

In many ways, Trump and Musk have complementary goals. Each has shown in their business careers that they abhor rules and regulations that constrain their actions. The political activity of the president and the tech visionary also shows disdain for checks and balances. Musk has recently been agitating on behalf of far-right parties in Europe, for example, mirroring Trump’s contempt for the will of voters in 2020.

And ahead of midterm elections in 2026, Republicans have every incentive to keep on the good side of the X owner, who threw many millions of dollars into electing Trump and fellow Republicans last year.'''
